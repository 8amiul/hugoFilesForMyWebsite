I wasn't a big fan of JavaScript. But later I realized that JS is so necessary for front-end web development. I recently just implemented an image viewer kind of page in my website, which needed JavaScript.

I actually don't know about JavaScript yet. There is a part of JavaScript
that connects it's functionality with HTML and CSS, that is called Document Object Model aka DOM.

The syntax is a bit like C. As I am comfortable with C so JavaScript is also not really giving me much pain. But it is way more bigger than C.

The basic concept of programming languages are the same. You'll have variable, loops, arrays, different kind of data types, functions, libraries to make life easier, OOP (maybe) and... that's all ig. So I am just learning the syntax and as well as some new features that come across while implementing more things in my site.


I would like to mention few resources which I found helpful,

- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [A YouTube video for DOM](https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys)
- Finally, [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)

I think learning by making a project does work better than following a tutorial.
