- Happiness is when I accept the fact that I'll get what I deserve. [26/06/25]

- Happiness is when I accept my limits and capabilities that I was not willing to alter. [29/06/25]

- Happiness is when I trust my gut and make my own decision to face its consequence. [01/07/25]

- Happiness is when I can let things go and assume my next step.. [04/07/25]
