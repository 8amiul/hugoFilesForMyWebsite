Finally, I am 20! Not really excited but glad to come this far.

I never really celebrated my birthday in a grand manner. The last time I cut a cake, I was probably 10 years old. Yeah, 15 years ago. I never really felt like cutting cakes, blowing candles, getting gifts or anything else. All I wanted was just to be with my friends and family. As a kid I learned that people cut cakes on their birthday. I remembered I also did and I was happy too. Who doesn't like cakes, gifts and etc things? Once we had a party at our house. Maybe some of my cousins and friends were there. I don't remember how old I was. I must have been happy then.

Now birthdays are just a day where I know that in this day I was born. Still special dishes are made, my parents and sibling do wish me at 12 O'clock just to make me happy. Just to show that they care about me and want to make me happy. When they wished me today, it felt so nice. I just thanked them. What more I could do. At least I've got some people who care for me.


Last year, I don't remember what I did on my birthday. It was chaos everywhere in our country. Lived an isolated time and without internet. But one thing I still remember, a birthday wish, made my day even in the worst time of that year. This year, that wish is nowhere to be found. If I wasn't so excited about that then maybe today I wouldn't sound so low.

I appreciate those people who wished me today. You, just a few people, have made my day. I don't know how you got my birthday in your mind. That doesn't even matter. What matters is that you have remembered me and wished me today. I hope you get to fullfil your dreams and live a healthy and happy life.

Yeah, bit of a gloomy birthday I am having. I could be happy if I were not brining unwanted thoughts out of nowhere. I guess a sleep will get rid of those things that I am afraid of.

Ah, one thing, my posts are now filled with non-tech shit. I'll be posting some actual stuff rather than spreading bullshit. FUCK THE REMINISCENCE!
