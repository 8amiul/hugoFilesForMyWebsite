## Eid Mubarak!

This Ramadan wasn't the best or productive one. However, celebrating eid shouldn't be denied. Hopefully we'll have a peaceful and a happy eid this year. We should visit our family, friends, neighbors and celebrate with everyone. Let us be part of ones celebration and let them be part of ours.

How fast time flies! 2023, 24 and now 25. I had another blog post about eid that was published in 2023. I wrote a lot of things about eid on that post. Later I understood that not everyone can celebrate eid. You obviously need family, friends and the mental peace. So, a lot to consider. Yes, it has been two years and a lot has changed!
