Can't really start with some joyful words this time. But it's eid and eid mubarak! Eid is indeed not eiding!

This eid is pretty messed up. Last time on Eid al-fitr it was better than my expectations. As I said, every family reunion is the best moment of my life. It actually happened last time. It's just not about the eid but we had a wedding ceremony for my cousin just a few weeks before. So due to that the eid also became a bit more exciting.

Qurbani eid, as we mainly say so I better continue with this. Last year I was so active on these, such as visiting the cattle market with friends. This year I didn't even get the smell of the cattle market.

This eid doesn't feel like an eid because I've got a damn exam coming.

It's eid and like always I'll say to celebrate it with friends and family. Be happy and make the surroundings happy. This eid is special. We gotta sac and make some partitions, one for you, one for them and one for me.

Finally, let us sac the animal outside and sac the evil inside and Eid Mubarak!
