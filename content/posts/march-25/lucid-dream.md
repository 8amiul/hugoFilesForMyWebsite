Dream is a fascinating phenomena. There are few types of dream. Some has an aspiration, that's one kind of dream, some see they are being haunted by a huge human like entity who got no facial structure just like a mannequin, some see many other interesting things... which is not our matter of discussion. However, Lucid dreaming is something which allows us to control what we see in our dreams.

Yeah, It's kind of like the scene from Mr. Robot.

*Mind Awake, body asleep*

So, you'll have the full access to do everything, have the allowance to choose and face consequences. But achieving a lucid dream isn't a piece of cake. I was able to lucid dream after continuously trying for a week. You may fail at first attempt, but one can do anything if he has the will.

Now I should share some tips which are followed by lucid dreamers in order to get this insane thing,

Have you ever thought why do we see dreams so vividly when it's early in the morning? around 4-5 o'clock. That's the best time for you to lucid dream.

Now get ready to sacrifice your sleep and mental health.

## WBTB - Wake Back To Bed

- Set an alarm for 30 minutes or an hour after you fall asleep. Try to wake up multiple times like this.

- When you'll wake up try staying for at least 5 minutes. On those 5 minutes try to write down what you've seen, what you'll see or just think that you have to lucid dream.

That was the first technique called WBTB-Wake Back To Bed. This one alone worked for me. This method will at least make you dream more vividly if it doesn't gift you lucid dream.

## WILD - Wake-Induced Lucid Dream
Next one, have you ever tried to make yourself think what you gonna dream tonight? You close your eyes and start thinking about a random scenario, a scenario where you living a life detached from the society full of creeps. Where you live in peace, do farming, build your house and many more shit. I don't know whether am I the only person to think like that or not but you have to do it for to get A FREAKING LUCID DREAM.

- Tell yourself that you'll lucid dream and keep visualizing things that you want to see.

Sadly, this method alone won't work, for me it didn't. You have to combine other methods with that to make it work. This one was *WILD-Wake-Induced Lucid Dream*

## FILD - FInger-Induced Lucid Dream

It's more like pseudo movement of your limbs or fingers. You just trick your brain so that it thinks that you are moving or doing something while you're still lying on bed. You may move your finger a bit but that should be so lightly that it doesn't even look like it's been moved. Consider playing an instrument or the best is typing with keyboard. 

Try combining this with *WILD*.

## What I did to achieve Lucid Dream?

For me it was quite simple. I combined all these methods and fell asleep on the usual time.

- I set an alarm for 3 hours.
- I woke up and stayed for few minutes, I walked a bit, went washroom, and the again lying on the bed started thinking that I'll lucid dream.
- The next thing I did was make myself think I am moving, doing things with my limbs.
- One thing, try to lie in bed with a different or unusual position. Maybe change or reverse the sleeping position.
- While my eyes were closed I tried to move my eyeballs like we do while we actually see things with opened eyes. 
- Then I focused on hearing things around me.
- Try best to rest your body and make yourself comfortable.
- Hopefully you'll achieve what you wanted.

So that's what I did to get this weird thing working. It was an amazing feeling. The dream was a bit different, when I did it first I saw that I was in my house and could go anywhere and do anything. But I couldn't visit a certain room as it was dark and it felt like there was a invisible barrier. However the dream felt a bit dark, light wasn't that bright, the color of wall was not exactly how it was in real. I didn't see anyone it was just me.

Second time I failed and it was kind of scary and also disappointing. I did everything but I actually got stuck and couldn't move at all. I felt like a dark black colored human like thing cuddling with me. It sounds so nice as I nicely described but it wasn't so satisfying, hahaha. So yes, it was sleep paralysis. I've encountered it several times in my life. Though that time it made so tired that when it got away I found myself sweating badly. I may have said something regarding this on the [image section of this site](/images) about that.

look, how romantic it is!

Despite failing and going through a sleep paralysis, I tried once again. Though it wasn't quite like a lucid dream. Later I felt like It will be a waste of time for me so I then didn't try it anymore as it badly affected my sleep cycle.

# Why one shouldn't try lucid dreaming?

Well, if you have got a lot of time for sleeping, don't care about your mental health and want to explore your dreams more deeply then hell yeah, do it.

But if you got work and have to wake up early or you being a student, I'll say it's not worth it. It's just a thing for people who have got a chance to sleep the next day away. Also it keeps bad impact on your health. Some people even fell way worse things than me. Just join this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming), here they share many things about lucid dreaming.

So that was all about LUCID DREAMING!
