It is a wonderful day for me. It’s raining and rain reminds me of my childhood. I still remember that I used to play video games on my uncle’s computer on rainy days. It’s not like I missed school because of rain. My luck wasn’t so great that time. I would pray for a rain fall so that I could skip school but sadly It had always rained when I was about to return home. If you are from Dhaka then you may know that sometimes Dhaka becomes that nice city from Italy called Venice.

Now we don’t see that Venice here cause it has been fixed and we city dwellers are greatful. At least I don’t see Venice here where I live but still there are many places where you can see it to happen. Also too much rain fall can cause this and which happened few months ago. Let’s not discuss this topic anymore.

Okay, I would return from school and get fresh then I would obviously turn on the computer to play games on it. I only had a single game that I liked most which was Grand Theft Auto Vice City. On that time it was the most popular games among kids. Cause you could do anything there kill innocent people, smash cars, blow up anything with panzer.

If you have ever played the modified GTA VC then you might be familiar with its radio. It was filled with Bangla and Hindi songs. I liked to listen to “Shada” and it was from Minar, a talented artist. It’s nostalgic song.

I always liked rain fall cause it gives nature its true face. I used to go with my friends to play football on these days. My parents said that I would fall sick because of it. But who cares about being sick when we got people with us! I actually used to get sick though.

There is a thing that I hate on these days. Which is it makes me feel like that everything is so dampy or wet. That sort of feeling would freak me out. I feel everything is so messed up. Kind of like it used to trigger OCD that time, even though I don’t have it.

Sleeping on those rainy days was something I always wanted. What more one can desire? I desire of delicious meals, a cozy bed and a device where I can listen music.

I don’t feel like writing anymore. Let us do chill on a rainy days!
