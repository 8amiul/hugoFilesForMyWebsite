I recently made a post about my sufferings due to biology exam. Surprisingly, it went nice. Perhaps I wasn't the person who deserved such a smooth exam. I was quite unsure of that exam as I didn't have the will to study. All praise to the almighty!

Besides everything, I was confident with my math exam. Because, I thought I liked to solve problems. I can stick with a problem until I solve it, I have that patience. But sadly this type of thing doesn't get that much value here in this exam or in any exams. Exam is not only about solving problems by thinking critically. Here one has a limited time and within that time one must answer those. Otherwise you be dead.

I realized that I could solve problems but just only when I am in my room lying in my bed. If you live in Bangladesh and keep knowledge about the students. Then you might have already heard that, this year questions are a bit weird. By saying weird I mean that something we didn't expect to see. Everyone thought that, like every year, boards would follow the trend. But it didn't happened so nicely this year. They chose randomness and they did it right.

I will not blame the board for making such questions. If I do, then I clearly trying to blame others for my lacking. I am not trying to be so different than others by stating such fact. I don't even care wether they make questions difficult or easy as I don't really count this exam so fancy phenomena in my life. Society might consider it as a valuable exam but does this exam even justify anything of a student?  Well, I am scared of the society as they will criticize and marginalize me if I fail to do well.

It doesn't justify the full potential of a human or a student. At least HSC doesn't! I have attended all the exams of HSC 25 so I know better than any boomers. Here exams are not equal to everyone. One may get some benefit and another may not. So, it might give you a preliminary idea about a person. Though, sometimes, that idea even goes wrong. I've seen countless people those who didn't do well in HSC but still they are living a good life. They are brilliant and they are no lesser than any other talented students. Now let us get back to the topic.

Yes, questions were so freaking difficult. Not everyone could answer it properly. Those who were hardworking students, they could only answer those. Then would get A+. However, in this way, we can exclude people, those who do not deserve an A+. Thus, we can normalize the fact that getting 4.69 isn't a bad result. Consider only 60 students got A+ in Dhaka board. Then will our parents and the society gonna compare all of us with those 60 people? If they do then it will be pathetic. I believe they will not do. But if 70% students get A+ and the rest can not, then definitely there will be people to say why you weren't in that 70%. Yeah, I said 60, which is a bit unrealistic for this decade but once people saw this sort of era. This year the rate of A+ won't fall so badly, which is clearly visible. But, certainly a downfall will occur. Somehow our standard is messed up (not brining how it got). Hope it gets fixed soon!

From my POV and with my ignorance, I'll say that questions were easy for those who studied. I didn't study so I must not find it easy. If I had studied I would have found it easier. This is the fact here. I don't want to blame others for my failure. Today, it was the worst HSC exam I have ever attended! But, still I have the balls to subdue the sadness that occurs or the tendency of blaming others for my own failure.
