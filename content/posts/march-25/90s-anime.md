I wasn't a big fan of anime. At this date, people are quite familiar with these japanese culture. In order to understand them I thought of adopting some changes. So I started watching anime.

I am someone who is pretty obsessed with old retro stuff. So there were chances that I might like anime those were made back in 80/90s.

If you have watched some retro anime then you must have noticed the variation of art styles. Those anime seems more vibrant to me. I feel like the actual japanese culture does reflect on those.

# Serial Experiments Lain
I at first started with '[Serial Experiments Lain](https://myanimelist.net/anime/339/Serial_Experiments_Lain)'.

“If you’re not remembered, then you never existed.” – Lain Iwakura

It was kind of... about a girl who knew nothing about computers turned into a geek and then there lot of things happened which I should not mention. Just watch it if you haven't yet. It got 8 of 10 on *myanimelist.net* and I guess it deserves that.

Now it's time I mention some tragic anime which is a bit devastating to watch. However, I liked every aspect of these two anime.

# Grave of the Fireflies
Or *Hotaru no Haka* is a perfect example of what I like.

It highlighted everything about war. How the people suffers, what starvation makes one to do, losing closest ones, hardships of orphans and homeless. Also, you can take life lessons from this one. You'll see that clearly in that anime. In this world, every activity holds something valuable which is worth learning. So i'ts obvious that one can learn something by watching anime.

This kind of war movies shows that how innocent people suffers and give their life just because of the pride of the empire and rulers.

Whatever, the next one is so badly underrated.

# Barefoot Gen
or *Hadashi no Gen* is so underrated and I don't know why it wasn't rated at least 8 out of 10. It's also a historical movie about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

It has plenty of tragic scenes which I liked. Kind of same as the previous anime as both of them have a common theme. Here you can find the hardship of people. Lack of food, fighting for food, frequent air raid and bombing, shelters, effects of an atomic bomb etc etc. There are also some creative dialogues and scenes.

I just mention one here,

> Gen: Shinji, what did you say to make Mother cry like that?

> Shinji: Gee, all I did was ask if I could suck on the fish bones when she was done with them.

> Gen: You're kidding, you asked her that?

> Shinji: Yeah, that was it.

> Gen: [hits Shinji on the head] Idiot!

I am obsessed with this kind of anime. I would like to watch more of these and I am searching for underrated 90s anime. If you have something for me then let me know I would be grateful to you. Yes, so this was me enjoying anime.
