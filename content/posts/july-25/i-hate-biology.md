Another note is gonna, probably, make me fall asleep. Whenever I try to write something, I start feeling asleep. Thus, I say to myself that the topic can go to hell and why should I talk about it and I sleep. Hopefully, I will not be writing this note fully like all the other unpublished notes. Tonight, I don't have anything specific to talk about. It will be about what I am going through right now. Within a day, I will be attending the Biology exam. I never liked Biology and never wanted to learn because it is a pain to study biology in our curriculum.

Biology is a nice subject I will say. It's interesting when I study it willingly . But when the curriculum forces me to  memorize the reactions of photosynthesis and respiration, gymnosperms and angiosperms, all those diversities of species and every possible bullshit, It is unbearable. I am reluctant to study biology. I took it as an optional subject. Though, it is optional but it is rather more important than any other subjects cause it can increase points on those subjects where I may not get A+.

I have a tendency to not do something that I don't like. Manly which needs a lot of memorization. Math is also about memorization. Some say it isn't but at one point it is. All those formulas and types where we can't go further if we are unaware about any of these. But still math is enjoyable. Formulas can easily be memorized by writing it a few times. Even organic chemistry seems easier than biology. Sounds funny, right? But it's my perspective. I ain't a good student who's getting A+ this time but still it doesn't make me inept at determining the difficulties.

Yeah, hope this phase of Biology goes quick and obviously well. Later I'll have math to deal with. It won't be so exhausting like biology. I am not saying I am good with math but at least I have an interest in studying it. I am waiting till this thing ends. I would be happy if they didn't allot that much gap between exams. It sucks my energy badly.

I don't know what I'll be doing tomorrow. Problem, just going to accept the fate. Now just before the exam, now I don't have anything in mind. Pretty, tough situation. I wish there was nothing called society. If the society wasn't there to judge me by my results then probably students wouldn't be so terrified of getting poor marks. At least I can say that they wouldn't hang themselves. Not a big fan of suicide. Our society has to change their mindset. Maybe it will happen one day but it will take so many years.

Another [Awful day](/posts/may-25/awful-day/) incarcerated!
