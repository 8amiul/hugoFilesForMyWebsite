It has been a long time since I posted on my site. I wasn't supposed to post today but something has made me write this note. I am irritated, frustrated, devastated and all the fucking words. It is 3 AM and still I am not sleeping perhaps now I would sleep after revising all the topics of chemistry. I was studying organic chemistry and suddenly I heard the news that we all, the HSC candidates, wanted to hear.

"The Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examinations scheduled for today have been postponed."

Well, at least it has been postponed. But at 3:00 AM? Just a few hours before the exam? What sort of fuckury it can be? How imperfect and unprofessional they can be. Could not they take wiser steps than showing hypocrisy? Sadly, even we claim that we have achieved the freedom of speech after sacrificing lives a year ago but can't be so judgemental. For what reason they became martyred? To get the freedom of speech, right? But do we still have the freedom of speech? If we had then I would not be using "they" instead of the exact word that I want to say. What if I say the word that I want? I will be vanished as the corpse has been today. (oh, shit! 3/4 letters orgs are about to get me). 

Today one of the worst catastrophes has occurred. Taking lives of many children. How many of them have been freed from this cruel country? The number is knowingly unknown. What makes me more sad is that they were just kids studying in class 3-4. Moreover, many other people also died with them. Most of them wanted to save this children. If they lived then those were to see the cruelty of us and our nation. A teacher burned herself just to save her students. It made me upset a lot. That's the only heroic act I currently can remember with sleep in my eyes. There are a lot of things to discuss about this incident. It was indeed terrific. Sorry for not being so descriptive here. Whatever, there were kids in that class room, sitting on those benches, sadly they don't look human anymore. They didn't even get to react to the heat of a jet plane crash.

It makes me sad to look at their parents. How can they accept the murders of those innocent children? Yes, I said murder. A young Flight Lieutenant, a valuable soul of this country, is a victim to this incident too. He also got murdered along with those innocent people. Murdered by whom? I don't know or even I know I won't say or can't say.

I don't have anymore energy left after watching the incident and clownery of our nation. I just want to blame this nation for killing those innocent children and people. The pointer points to use somehow. If you think deeply then you will know that we actually are the reason for this. We let it happen. We never stood against it before it could happen. We know it would happen or at least they know. But what? They let it happen.

We never were good and never will be. We never learned a lesson and never will be learning.
We are meant to be oppressed. We are meant to be dead.
