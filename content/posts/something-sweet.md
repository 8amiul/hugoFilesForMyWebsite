Yesterday I ate something different. A different recipe I've found. Last time I cooked noodles and now I present you this! I actually don't know what to name it.

I was starving and I didn't even have the time to go out and bring something. I thought why not try something new with what I have within my reach.

I've eaten this kind of food before. That brown juice kind of thing is from date. The ingredients are actually,

- Bread slices
- Date Juice 
- Powdered Milk
- Banana slices 

Just mixed these and I could add some more stuff if I had. I found these things near so I didn't bother thinking of adding more.

You may try this if you are curious or like to try weird or different foods.
It tasted good. However I don't really like sweets and foods that has sugar. But it was not bad.
